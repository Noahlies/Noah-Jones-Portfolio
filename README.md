# Noah-Jones-Portfolio

This repo is where I’m putting all of my applied math, physics modeling, computational, and data science projects.

I’m using this to organize the work I’ll be doing between semesters and throughout next year. Stuff here will include:
- computational physics simulations
- math modeling projects
- data analysis and visualization
- Python and Java practice

More will get added as I go.
